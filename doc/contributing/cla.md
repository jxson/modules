# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Before patches can be accepted, contributors must sign the Google Individual
[Contributor License Agreement (CLA)][cla], which can be done online. The CLA
is necessary since contributors own the copyright to their code, even after it
becomes part of the codebase, so permission is required to use and distribute
that code. Contributors don't have to sign the CLA until after a patch has
been submitted for review and a member has approved it, but the CLA must be
signed before the patch is committed into the codebase.

Contributions made by corporations are covered by a different agreement than
the one above, the [Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License
Agreement][corp-cla].
