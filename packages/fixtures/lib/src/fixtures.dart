I actually haven't started putting a doc together yet. Maybe we can work on it together later this week.

And we're planning to depart BDQ on 5/31 at 5:00pm.

1) We enlist an A-list celebrity to promote the line. As I understand, Shamra is in town, so we might be able to convince her to pitch this line of socks if we're sufficiently compelling.


2) We create a cartoon series about anthropomorphic socks.


What do you think?
